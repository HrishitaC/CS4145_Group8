The **lack of a significant period of incarceration** or rehabilitation may not have adequately addressed the underlying issues contributing to her criminal behavior.

It is also possible that she has learned from her past mistakes and has taken steps to avoid repeating them, such as seeking counseling or participating in support programs. These factors, combined with the passage of time, suggest a reduced likelihood of reoffending.	1	Misdemeanour: Driving under Influence with Property Damage/Injury	0	"""0"""	"""Low riskt"""	"""3"""								https://platform.toloka.ai/task/39712985/00025df8d9--648e1df4d7c375249d15b451	00025df8d9--648e0252a1af7c7d84abb7dd	00025df8d9--648e1df4d7c375249d15b451	b39e77ec229a623e22040e9e63bc0b1e	APPROVED	2023-06-17T20:56:20.911
